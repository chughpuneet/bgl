# Game of Life Simulator

## Overview

This project simulates **Conway's Game of Life** on a configurable 2D grid. Each cell can be **alive** or **dead**, and the grid evolves generation by generation based on standard rules:

- Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbours dies (**underpopulation**)
- Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours survives (**survival**)
- Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbours dies (**overpopulation**)
- Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbours becomes alive (**reproduction**)

The project is designed following **SOLID principles**, **Singleton pattern**, **Factory pattern**, **Strategy pattern**, **Rule Engine pattern**, and **TDD practices** for maintainable and testable code.

## Features

- Configurable **grid size**
- Place initial **alive cells** at specific coordinates
- Advance the simulation **generation by generation**
- Rule-based evaluation using a **CellStateEvaluator**
- Validate **grid dimensions** and **cell positions**
- Support for **eight-neighbour** cell evaluation and extensible for any future neighbour finding strategies
- Output the alive cells at each generation

## Design

- **Rules**:  
  Each rule (`AliveCellUnderPopulationDeathRule`, `AliveCellOverPopulationDeathRule`, `AliveCellSurvivalRule`, `DeadCellReproductionRule`) implements `CellStateTransitionRule` 
- These rules define conditions for a cellâ€™s next state. 
- All rules are implemented as **Singletons** to avoid multiple instances.
- Rules are extensible

- **Cell State Evaluation**:
    - `CellStateEvaluator` applies all rules to determine a cell's next state in a generation.
    - Follows **Open/Closed principle**, allowing easy addition of new rules.

- **Neighbour Finding Strategy**:
    - `CellNeighboursFinder` abstract class defines how to find neighbours.
    - `CellEightNeighboursFinder` implements the logic to find eight neighbours, using the **Strategy pattern** and is a **Singleton**.

- **Models & State**:
    - `Cell`: Represents a single cell with `row` and `column`.
    - `Grid`: Represents the 2D grid and validates if a cell is within bounds.
    - `AliveGeneration`: Maintains the **current state of alive cells** for a generation.
    - `GameOfLifeBoard`: Combines `Grid` and `AliveGeneration`, exposes neighbour and state operations, and acts as the **central model holding the current generation state**.

- **Validator**:
    - Ensures board integrity using `Validator` interface implementations: `GridRowsValidator`, `GridColumnsValidator`, `OutOfBoundCellValidator`.
    - Validators are implemented as **Singletons**.
    - Validators are extensible and can be extended for future requirements.
    - `ValidatorFactory` acts as a **Factory** to create pre-defined sets of validators for the board. This can be extended to define the validations in different situations
    - `GameOfLifeBoardValidator` validates all the conditions provided and returns list of validation failure messages as defined in the validation rules

- **Simulator / Application**:
    - `GameOfLifeSimulator` simulates the next generation. It defines set of game rules applied to evaluate next generation along with neighbour finding strategy
    - `GenerationEvaluator` generic **evaluator** evaluates the next generation based on the provided rules and neighbour finding strategy.

## Input Format

### Initial setup:
- Grid dimensions (columns, rows) (x, y)
- Initial alive cells coordinates (e.g., `{{5,5},{6,5},{7,5}}`)

### Simulation:
- Advance the simulation to the **next generation** using `advanceToNextGeneration()` method

---

## Start Application

- **Run `GameOfLifeApplication` main class** to start the simulation.
